<!-- Surface projection of the slip distribution superimposed on GEBCO -->
<!-- bathymetry. Thick white lines indicate major plate boundaries [Bird, 2003]. Gray circles, if present, are aftershock locations, sized by magnitude. -->

<h2>Cross-section of slip distribution</h2>
<img SRC="web/[EVENT]_slip2.png"><br /><br />
<p>
Cross-section of slip distribution. The strike direction is indicated
above each fault plane and the hypocenter location is denoted by a
star. Slip amplitude is shown in color and the motion direction of the
hanging wall relative to the footwall (rake angle) is indicated with
arrows. Contours show the rupture initiation time in seconds.

<h2>Moment Rate Function</h2><br />
<img SRC="web/mr.png"><br /><br />
<p>
Source time function, describing the rate of moment release with time
after earthquake origin, relative to the peak moment rate (listed in
the top right corner of the plot).
